# Inventory-Management-System
Database Management System Project on the Inventory Management System using SQL

I have created a DBMS project wherein I have shared the report file of my project which i have implemented using Structured Query Language(SQL). This file also contains a rough relational diagram for better understanding.

The project contains a basic database file which contains the table creation and relation commands. Other than that there's an example data entry which you can use to test out the project after entering the data manually. After that, you need to run the PL/SQL based functions to obtain the desired results.
