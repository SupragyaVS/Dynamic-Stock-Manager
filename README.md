# Inventory-Management-System
Database Management System Project on the Inventory Management System using SQL

This repository contains a Database Management System (DBMS) project focused on Inventory Management. The project is implemented using Structured Query Language (SQL). It includes a comprehensive report file and a relational diagram for a better understanding of the project's structure and functionality.

**Project Components**
*1. Database Schema and Tables*
The project starts with the creation of the database schema and tables. These tables define the structure of my inventory management system and hold essential data. The SQL script for table creation and relationships can be found in the project files.

*2. Example Data Entry*
To facilitate testing and demonstration, I have included an example data entry file. You can manually enter data into the tables to simulate real-world inventory scenarios.

*3. PL/SQL-Based Functions*
These functions are designed to perform various tasks related to inventory management, including:

-Updating item details.
-Calculating available stock.
-Generating reports on inventory status.

These functions are executed using SQL queries, providing a comprehensive set of tools to manage inventory efficiently.
